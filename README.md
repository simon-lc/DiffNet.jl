# DiffNet.jl
With DiffNet.jl you can quickly build fully connected neural networks. 
DiffNet.jl provides methods for fast and allocation-free evaluation of the neural network for a given input and given parameters. 
It also provides methods for fast and allocation-free computation of the Jacobians of the output wih respect to the input and the parameters. 

See [this example](../main/examples/net.jl) for more details.
